            <h3> Training Approach </h3>
            <br>
            <p> Start with your dog in a sitting position. <br> <br>
                Raise your hand and say "High-Five" while encouraging them to touch your palm with their paw. <br> <br>
                Reward immediately when they make contact, reinforcing the association between the command and the action. <br> <br>
                Repeat and Practice:  After the initial successful attempt, encourage your dog to repeat the high-five several times. Repeat the command and gesture consistently to reinforce the association.  <br> <br> 
                Gradual Reduction of Treats: As your dog becomes more proficient in performing the high-five, gradually reduce the frequency of treats.  <br> <br>

        <p> Teach Loose-Leash Walking: Reward your dog with treats when the leash is loose. Stop walking if they pull and start again when they calm down. <br> <br>
            Change Direction: Randomly change your walking direction. This helps keep your dog focused on you.<br> <br>
            Use No-Pull Harnesses: Consider using a harness that discourages pulling. It makes walks more comfortable for both you and your dog.<br> <br>

        <p> Gradual Desensitization: Practice leaving your dog for short periods, then gradually increase the time. Reward them when you return.<br> <br>
            Create a Safe Space: Make a cozy space for your dog with their bed and toys. It helps them feel secure when you're not around.<br> <br>
            Reward Calm Behavior: When leaving or coming home, wait for your dog to be calm. Reward them when they're not overly excited.<br> <br><br> <br>
            Consistency is Key: Always use the same commands and rewards so your dog understands what you want.<br> <br>
            Positive Reinforcement: Use treats, praise, or play to show your dog they did something good.<br> <br>
            Patience and Persistence: Changing behavior takes time. Keep at it, and be patient with your dog.<br> <br><br> <br>
            Seek Professional Help: If things don't improve, consider getting advice from a professional dog trainer or behaviorist.<br> <br>
            Remember, every dog learns at their own pace. Stay positive and celebrate the small victories along the way!
